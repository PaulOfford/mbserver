South Africa and the United States are to start testing a new preventative HIV vaccine and have begun enrolling participants to take part in a clinical trial.

The VIR-1388 vaccine is intended to instruct the immune system to produce T-cells "that can recognise HIV and signal an immune response to prevent the virus from establishing chronic infection".
