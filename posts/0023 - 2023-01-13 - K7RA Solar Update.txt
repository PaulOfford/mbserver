Wow! Sunspot numbers up, geomagnetic disturbances down. What could be better? Okay, maybe Solar Cycle 19, but that was 66 years ago and by far the all time largest.

But this is now, we are in Solar Cycle 25, and this sunspot cycle is emerging better than the consensus forecast. It is predicted to peak about 30 months from now in Summer 2025.
