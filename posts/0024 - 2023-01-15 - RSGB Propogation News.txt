Sunspot region 3186 has rotated into view off the Sun's northeast limb and produce an X1.0 solar flare at 2247UTC on the 10 January. It may have thrown some plasma into space in the form of a Coronal Mass Ejection but, as it is not yet directly facing Earth, the CME is likely directed away from us.

We currently have an SFI in the 190s.
